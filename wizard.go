// ctrl+c, closing it, SIGINT/SIGTERM, or "Install FreeCAD on this computer
// first") leaves the machine unchanged, and the process exits with
// exitCancelled so the install scripts can roll back the binary they just

//     clients the user switched off (their value is false). Dropping false
//     entries after each update makes the list show what will be registered.
//   - Its enter does nothing while no client is selected. Here the addon is
//     worth installing on its own (no AI client yet, or one registered by
//     hand), so enter moves on and registration reports that nothing was
//     configured.
//   - It pre-selects clients whose entry was edited by hand or runs another
//     program (see clients.go), and registering replaces that entry. Those
//     start unticked here, with a note saying why, so what is there is only
//     replaced on request.
//   - Revisiting the step detects the clients again, but the library keeps
//     taking keys meanwhile, which would act on the previous list. Keys other
//     than cancel wait until the new list is shown.
