# Tools

[Back to README](../README.md) · [Installation](installation.md) · [Configuration](configuration.md) · [Code execution](execution.md) · [Remote access](remote-access.md)

FreeCAD MCP exposes 42 tools, grouped below by task; two of them,
`release_session` and `close_freecad`, are listed only while
[remote access](remote-access.md) is on, since they manage the multi-agent
session lock that comes with it. Every tool that changes a document records
its change as one named transaction, next to edits made by hand in FreeCAD,
so `undo` and `redo` cover it. Placements use degrees: a `Rotation`'s `Angle`
is given to `create_object` and `update_object` in degrees, and `get_object`
and `list_objects` report it in degrees.

Every tool carries a title and behaviour hints (read-only, changes something,
runs code) that clients use for approval prompts, and the server sends short
instructions that name the rules shared by all tools: units, expressions,
links, finding faces with `list_subelements`, paths and the session. The
`freecad-mcp-guide` skill (see [installation](installation.md#the-guide-skill))
adds workflows across tools, and the `asset_creation_strategy` prompt returns
its home text.

Most tools take a `doc_name`, the internal name `list_documents` shows (not
necessarily the document's label), and many take `obj_name` the same way from
`list_objects`. A tool that changes a document reports objects left invalid
by the change and how to fix or remove them.

Every path a tool takes is on the computer running FreeCAD; with
[remote access](remote-access.md) that is another computer than the one
running the AI client or the MCP server, and no file is transferred over
this connection: see [file paths](remote-access.md#file-paths).
`execute_code_headless` is the exception: its script runs on the computer
hosting the MCP server, so its paths are on that computer instead.

## Document lifecycle

### `create_document`

Create a new, empty document and make it active. Use it before `create_object`
when no document exists yet.

- `name` (string, required): the name of the document to create.

The reply carries the name FreeCAD gave the document (not always exactly
`name`), which later calls take as `doc_name`.

### `list_documents`

List every open document with its label, file, whether it has unsaved changes
or needs a recompute, whether it is active, and its views (tabs) with their
index. Takes no arguments.

The reply is a table of name, label, file, modified, active and views; an
empty list says to call `create_document` or `open_document`. Use it first to
find the `doc_name` other tools take and the `view_index` `activate_document`
takes.

### `open_document`

Open a `.FCStd` file from an absolute path on the machine running FreeCAD,
without any dialog, and make it active.

- `path` (string, required): absolute path of the `.FCStd` file.
- `hidden` (boolean, default `false`): open without a 3D view tab.
- `activate` (boolean, default `true`): make it the active document.
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 120, up to 1800 seconds): the queue and
  execution budget; raise it for large assemblies.

A file that is already open is not reloaded; the reply says so and names the
document, its object count and whether it needs a recompute. Opened hidden, it
has no view to activate until a later `activate_document` call with
`create_view` true. Use `import_file` for STEP, STL, 3MF and other formats,
and `reload_document` to pick up changes made to an already open file on disk.

A file saved without a GUI, for example by `execute_code_headless`, stores no
camera, and FreeCAD opens its objects hidden. The addon corrects that for any
open of such a file, not only this tool's: it shows the objects the file stores
as visible (an Origin keeps FreeCAD's own default), points the 3D view at them
from the Isometric direction once the view is laid out, and leaves the document
unmodified. That covers `open_document`, `reload_document`, the `file` of
`start_freecad`, File > Open, a double click and the recent files list, and a
document opened hidden when it later gets a 3D view. Files saved by FreeCAD's GUI
keep their saved visibility and camera.

### `activate_document`

Make an open document the active one and bring its tab to the front.

- `doc_name` (string, required): the document to activate.
- `view_index` (integer, optional, 0 to 1000): which of the document's views
  to activate, as `list_documents` numbers them; default its active view.
- `create_view` (boolean, default `false`): open a 3D view when the document
  has none, for example after opening it hidden.

Tools without a `doc_name`, such as `execute_code` and
`insert_part_from_library`, act on whichever document this made active. A
document opened hidden needs `create_view` true before `get_view` can
screenshot it.

### `reload_document`

Close and reopen a document to pick up changes made to its `.FCStd` file
outside the FreeCAD GUI, for example by a script run with
`execute_code_headless` that edited and saved it.

- `doc_name` (string, required): the document to reload.

Fails when the document is not open, or was never saved to a file (nothing to
reload from). The open GUI document is otherwise unaware of on-disk changes;
this closes the stale in-memory copy and reopens the file.

### `save_document`

Save an open document to its own `.FCStd` file, without any dialog.

- `doc_name` (string, required): the document to save.
- `recompute` (boolean, default `true`): recompute the document first when it
  needs it.
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 120, up to 1800 seconds).

A document that was never saved has no file yet: use `save_document_as`
instead. The reply names the file and lists objects left invalid by the
recompute; `list_documents` shows which documents have unsaved changes.

### `save_document_as`

Save an open document to a new `.FCStd` file at an absolute path.

- `doc_name` (string, required): the document to save.
- `path` (string, required): absolute path to write; `.FCStd` is appended when
  the name has no extension.
- `overwrite` (boolean, default `false`): replace an existing file at `path`.
- `copy` (boolean, default `false`): write a copy and keep the document on its
  current file and name.
- `recompute` (boolean, default `true`).
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 120, up to 1800 seconds).

Without `copy`, the document then uses that file and its label becomes the
file name. A missing folder in `path` is created, and the reply says so. A
file another open document already uses is refused. Use
`export_document` for STEP, STL, 3MF and other exchange formats.

### `close_document`

Close an open document and its tabs.

- `doc_name` (string, required): the document to close.
- `discard_changes` (boolean, default `false`): close even with unsaved
  changes, losing them.

A document with unsaved changes is refused unless `discard_changes` is true;
call `save_document` first to keep them, or `save_document_as` when the
document was never saved (the refusal says which). The reply names
the document active afterwards, or says none is. FreeCAD asks no questions, so
nothing waits for a person.

## Objects

### `create_object`

Create a new object in a document.

- `doc_name` (string, required): the document to create the object in.
- `obj_type` (string, required): the FreeCAD type, for example `Part::Box`,
  `Part::Cylinder`, `Part::Cut`, `PartDesign::Body`, `Fem::ConstraintFixed`.
- `obj_name` (string, required): the name to give the object.
- `analysis_name` (string, optional): for FEM objects, the FEM analysis to add
  the object to.
- `obj_properties` (object, optional): the properties to set at creation,
  for example `{"Height": 30, "Radius": 10}`.
- `include_screenshot` (boolean, default `true`), `view_name` (string, default
  `"Isometric"`): see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).

`obj_type` must name a type registered in FreeCAD's type system (most
`Part::`, `PartDesign::` and `Fem::` types). A handful of Python-implemented
types are supported through dedicated factories instead, each needing the
properties listed:

```
Part::Tube        InnerRadius, OuterRadius, Height
Draft::Circle     Radius
Draft::Rectangle  Length, Height
Draft::Polygon    FacesNumber, Radius
Draft::Wire       Points (list of {x, y, z}), optional Closed
```

Any other Python-implemented type must be built with `execute_code` instead.
The Draft factories name objects themselves, so for those the returned object
name can differ from the requested `obj_name`, which becomes the object's
Label instead; always use the returned name in later calls. A `Placement`'s
`Rotation.Angle` is in degrees; `ViewObject.ShapeColor` is `[r, g, b, a]` from
0 to 1.

The reply names the created object and, unless `include_screenshot` is false,
carries a screenshot. An object that was created but failed to compute still
stays in the document under its name, reported as an error naming it, with a
hint to fix it with `update_object` or remove it with `delete_object`. When
creating the object or setting one of its properties raises an error, nothing
is left behind: the call's transaction is discarded (or, when the call joined a
transaction already open in FreeCAD, the new objects are removed by hand), and
the error ends with "Nothing was created." An object that was created but
does not compute stays and the reply names it, as above.

A `Fem::ConstraintForce` acts along the outward normal of its first face (or
along its `Direction` link when set) and a `Fem::ConstraintPressure` acts into
its face; `Reversed` true flips either. A load with no face referenced yet
says "no face is referenced yet, so no direction is known yet". The reply of
`create_object` and
`update_object` for such a constraint states the direction as a vector in
global coordinates and in words, for example "Force 500.00 N acts along (0, 0,
1): the outward normal of Face3." and "Pressure 2000.00 kPa acts along (0, 0,
-1): into the face, against the outward normal of Face6."

#### Property values

The same forms apply to `create_object` and `update_object`:

- Numbers on a quantity property (length, force, pressure and so on) are in
  FreeCAD's base units: `{"Force": 100}` is 100 mm\*kg/s^2, which is 0.1 N. Pass
  units as strings instead: `"100 N"`, `"5 mm"`, `"210 GPa"`. The reply lists
  every quantity property the call set, and `get_object` and `list_objects`
  show every quantity, in the units FreeCAD prefers for it (its own property
  editor's units), for example `Force: 100.00 N` and `Pressure: 2000.00 kPa`.
- A string map property, such as the `Material` of `Fem::MaterialCommon`, takes
  numbers as well as strings: `{"Material": {"Name": "Steel", "YoungsModulus":
  "210 GPa", "PoissonRatio": 0.3, "Density": "7900 kg/m^3"}}`. FreeCAD stores
  each value as text.
- A dotted name sets one part of a compound property and leaves the rest:
  `{"Placement.Base.z": 5}`, `{"Placement.Rotation.Angle": 30}` (degrees). It
  reads the property, changes the part and assigns it back. `Rotation.Angle`
  turns about the current axis (`(0, 0, 1)` for an object not turned yet); set
  a whole `Rotation` to change the axis. The settable parts of a Placement are
  `Base.x`, `Base.y`, `Base.z`, `Rotation.Angle`, `Rotation.Yaw`,
  `Rotation.Pitch` and `Rotation.Roll` (degrees) and `Rotation.Axis.x`, `.y`
  and `.z` (FreeCAD renormalises the axis); a part takes a number or an
  expression, not a dict. A dotted name gets no quantity line in the reply.
  A dotted name also
  takes an expression, `{"Placement.Base.z": "=Params.thickness"}`, which calls
  `setExpression` on that path, and a bare `"="` removes it. A part name the
  property lacks is an error naming the path.
- A link property takes an object name: any `App::PropertyLink*` property
  (`Base`, `Tool`, `Source`, `Profile`, and so on) takes a string, and any
  `App::PropertyLinkList*` property (`Shapes` of `Part::MultiFuse` and
  `Part::MultiCommon`, `Group`, and so on) takes a list of strings. A name that
  is not in the document is an error.
- A string starting with `=` binds an expression, as the spreadsheet tools do:
  `{"Height": "=Params.thickness"}` calls `setExpression("Height",
  "Params.thickness")`. A bare `"="` removes the binding.
- `References` takes a list whose entries are `{"object_name": "Box", "face":
  "Face1"}`, `{"object_name": "Box", "faces": ["Face1", "Face2"]}`, `["Box",
  "Face1"]` or `["Box", ["Face1", "Face2"]]`; any other entry is an error that
  lists these four forms. `list_subelements` shows which face is which.

### `update_object`

Set properties of an existing object, in the same form `create_object` takes
(see [property values](#property-values)).

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `obj_name` (string, required): the object to update.
- `obj_properties` (object, required): the properties to set.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).

Use it when `create_object` cannot set a property at creation time, then
verify the result with `get_object`. The reply lists the quantity properties
the call set with their resulting values and units.

### `delete_object`

Delete an object from a document.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `obj_name` (string, required): the object to delete.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).

Objects that depend on it, for example a `Part::Cut` using it as Base or Tool,
may become invalid; call `list_objects` afterwards to check the document.

### `list_objects`

List every object in a document with its type and properties.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `compact` (boolean, default `false`): short rows (name, label, type, state,
  valid, parent, visible) instead of every property.
- `include_screenshot` (boolean, default `false`), `view_name`: see
  [screenshot options](#screenshot-options). The screenshot is off unless
  `include_screenshot` is passed as `true`.

Use it before changing a document to see what exists and which names to pass
to `get_object`, `update_object` and `delete_object`. An unknown document
gives an empty list; `list_documents` shows the open ones.

### `get_object`

Get one object with its type and all its properties.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `obj_name` (string, required)
- `include_screenshot` (boolean, default `false`), `view_name`: see
  [screenshot options](#screenshot-options). The screenshot is off unless
  `include_screenshot` is passed as `true`.

Use it to check the values `update_object` or `create_object` set, or to see
which properties an object has before updating it. Its `Shape` block gives
the volume, area, vertex, edge, face and solid counts (`SolidCount`, so a fused
result shown as one Compound of two solids is clear), the bounding box and the
centre of mass; quantities are in FreeCAD's preferred units. A missing object
is a not-found error naming `list_objects` and `list_documents` as next steps.

## Measurement and selection

### `measure`

Measure FreeCAD geometry in global coordinates.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `kind` (string, required, one of `distance`, `angle`, `length`, `radius`,
  `area`, `volume`).
- `refs` (array, required, at least one entry): the objects or sub-elements to
  measure, each `{"object": name, "sub"?: element}`.

`distance` and `angle` take exactly two refs, `radius` exactly one, `length`,
`area` and `volume` take one or more. `distance` is the shortest distance
between two objects or sub-elements, with the closest points; `angle` is
between two straight edges or planar faces; `length` sums edge length;
`radius` reads a circular edge or a cylindrical or spherical face; `area` and
`volume` sum over faces or solids.

A ref's `sub` is either a plain element name on the object itself (`Face3`,
`Edge1`, `Vertex2`), or the full object path `get_selection` returns for
anything below the top level (`Body.Pad.Face3`); pass `get_selection`'s
`sub_elements` unchanged rather than shortening them, which would pick that
element on the top object instead. Without `sub`, the whole object is used.

The reply gives the value and its unit (`mm`, `deg`, `mm^2`, `mm^3`), and for
`distance` the two closest points. A `sub` naming no face, edge or vertex of an
object that does resolve to a shape is a not-found error whose hint points to
`list_subelements` for the object's face and edge names; `volume` on an
object with no solid is an invalid-input error. `get_object`'s bounding box
(the tight one, exact on curved and swept parts) also helps size an object
without a full measurement.

### `get_selection`

Read what the user has selected in FreeCAD.

- `doc_name` (string, optional): the document whose selection to read; default
  every open document.

The reply is a table of document, object, label, type and sub-elements
(`Face6`, `Edge12`, and so on), plus the picked points. Use it when the user
refers to "this face" or "the selected edge", then pass the names to `measure`
or `update_object`. An empty result means nothing is selected.

### `list_subelements`

List the faces and edges of an object with their names and geometry. It reads
the document and changes nothing.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `obj_name` (string, required)
- `kind` (string, default `"faces"`, one of `faces`, `edges`, `all`).

The reply is a table per kind, in global coordinates, lengths in mm and areas
in mm^2. Each face row gives its name (`Face1`), surface type (`plane`,
`cylinder`, `cone`, `sphere`, `torus` or `other`), area and centre of mass,
plus the normal of a plane and the radius and axis of a cylinder or sphere.
Each edge row gives its name (`Edge1`), curve type (`line`, `circle` or
`other`) and length, plus the radius and centre of a circle. Use it to find the
face to pass to `measure` as a `sub`, or to a `References` entry such as a FEM
constraint's. An object with no shape, or an unknown object or document, is an
error.

## Mesh operations

### `analyze_mesh`

Analyze a mesh object (`Mesh::Feature`, for example an imported STL or 3MF)
for the defects that break 3D printing and `mesh_to_solid`.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `obj_name` (string, required): the mesh object.
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 120, up to 1800 seconds).

Checks whether the mesh is a closed solid, non-manifold edges,
self-intersections, wrongly oriented facets, invalid points, corrupted facets
and separate components. The reply lists the issues found and the
`repair_mesh` steps that address them; the document is not changed.

### `repair_mesh`

Repair a mesh object in place by running named steps in order.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `obj_name` (string, required): the mesh object.
- `steps` (array of strings, optional): steps to run, from `fix_indices`,
  `remove_invalid_points`, `remove_duplicated_points`,
  `remove_duplicated_facets`, `fix_degenerations`, `fix_deformations`,
  `remove_non_manifolds`, `remove_non_manifold_points`,
  `fix_self_intersections`, `remove_folds`, `harmonize_normals`,
  `flip_normals`, `fill_holes`. Default: `fix_indices`,
  `remove_duplicated_points`, `remove_duplicated_facets`,
  `fix_degenerations`, `remove_non_manifolds`, `fix_self_intersections`,
  `harmonize_normals`, `fill_holes`.
- `fill_holes_max_edges` (integer, default 20, 3 to 10000): the largest hole
  `fill_holes` closes, by its edge count.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 300, up to 1800 seconds).

Run `analyze_mesh` first and pass the steps it suggests, or omit `steps` for
the standard sequence above. The reply compares the mesh before and after each
step; undo reverts the whole repair in one step.

### `mesh_to_solid`

Convert a mesh object into a new Part solid that booleans, fillets and export
to STEP can work with.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `obj_name` (string, required): the mesh object.
- `result_name` (string, optional): name for the new object; default
  `obj_name` followed by `_solid`.
- `tolerance` (number, default 0.1, up to 10 mm): distance within which mesh
  edges are sewn together.
- `refine` (boolean, default `false`): merge coplanar triangles into larger
  faces, slower but lighter to model on.
- `force` (boolean, default `false`): convert meshes over 200000 facets, which
  can take minutes and much memory.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 300, up to 1800 seconds).

Each triangle becomes its own face, so the result has as many faces as the
mesh had triangles unless `refine` merges the coplanar ones together
afterwards; `refine` adds time on top of the conversion itself, in exchange
for a solid with far fewer faces to fillet, boolean or export later. A mesh
that is not closed gives a shell, not a solid; run `analyze_mesh` and
`repair_mesh` first. Over 200000 facets without `force` is a conflict error
with a hint to retry with `force` true. The mesh object is kept.

### `solid_to_mesh`

Tessellate an object's shape (a Part feature, Body, Link or `App::Part`) into
a new mesh object.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `obj_name` (string, required): the object with a shape.
- `result_name` (string, optional): default `obj_name` followed by `_mesh`.
- `quality` (string, default `"standard"`, one of `coarse`, `standard`,
  `fine`): tessellation preset.
- `linear_deflection` (number, optional, 0.001 to 100 mm): overrides the
  preset's largest distance between the surface and its triangles.
- `angular_deflection_deg` (number, optional, 0.5 to 90 degrees): overrides
  the preset's largest angle between neighbouring triangles.
- `relative` (boolean, default `false`): `linear_deflection` relative to each
  edge's length.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 300, up to 1800 seconds).

Use it to inspect or repair the triangles a printer will get, with
`analyze_mesh`; `export_document` tessellates by itself, so this is not needed
before exporting. The source object is kept.

## Spreadsheets

### `get_spreadsheet_cells`

Read cells of a FreeCAD spreadsheet (`Spreadsheet::Sheet`).

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `sheet_name` (string, required): the `Spreadsheet::Sheet` object.
- `cells` (array of strings, optional): addresses such as `B2`, ranges such as
  `A1:C10`, or aliases; default every non-empty cell, up to 2000.

Spreadsheets usually hold the parameters that drive a parametric model through
expressions. The reply is a table of cell, alias, content as entered (such as
`=Length*2`), computed value, and any error for that cell. An unknown sheet
name is a not-found error with a hint to create one with `create_object` and
`obj_type` `Spreadsheet::Sheet`.

### `update_spreadsheet_cells`

Set the content and aliases of cells, then recompute the document so
dependent objects update.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `sheet_name` (string, required)
- `cells` (array, required, 1 to 500 entries): each `{"cell": address or
  alias, "content"?: string, "alias"?: string}`, needing at least one of
  `content` or `alias`. Content is a number with an optional unit, text, or an
  expression starting with `=`; an empty string clears a cell or removes an
  alias.
- `recompute` (boolean, default `true`): recompute afterwards so dependent
  objects update.

The reply shows each changed cell's new value and any objects that became
invalid; undo reverts the whole change in one step. Its content column is
FreeCAD's stored text: an expression or a number with a unit starts with `=`
(`=5 mm`), text starts with `'`, and a plain number has no mark; the reply says
so. A bad address or alias in
the batch (already used, syntactically invalid, or a reserved word such as a
unit or a constant) is rejected before anything is changed. A failure caught
only once FreeCAD applies it rolls this call's own changes back: when it
opened its own transaction, aborting it leaves no undo step at all; joined
into an already-open transaction (a command or task panel active in FreeCAD),
it restores each already-applied cell by hand instead. A sheet left invalid by
its own erroring cells is not fixed with `update_object`; the reply points at
`get_spreadsheet_cells` with the erroring cell addresses instead.

## Import and export

### `import_file`

Import a CAD, mesh or 2D file into a document, without any dialog.

- `path` (string, required): absolute path of the file to import.
- `doc_name` (string, optional): the open document to import into; omit to
  create a new document named after the file.
- `merge` (boolean, optional): STEP, IGES and glTF only, merge the file's
  parts into one compound; default FreeCAD's import preference.
- `use_link_group` (boolean, optional): STEP, IGES and glTF only, build
  assemblies from `App::Link` groups; default FreeCAD's import preference.
- `import_hidden` (boolean, optional): STEP, IGES and glTF only, also import
  objects the file marks hidden; default FreeCAD's import preference.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 300, up to 1800 seconds): raise it for
  large assemblies.

Supported extensions: `.step`/`.stp`, `.iges`/`.igs`, `.gltf`/`.glb`
(assemblies keep their parts and colors), `.brep`/`.brp`, `.stl`/`.ast`,
`.obj`, `.off`, `.ply`, `.3mf` (triangle meshes), `.dxf` and `.svg` (2D
geometry). The reply lists the created objects with their names for
`get_object` and `update_object`, the importer used, and any objects left
invalid by the recompute. Undo removes the whole import in one step.

Mesh files become Mesh objects, not solids: call `mesh_to_solid` to turn one
into a Part solid, or `analyze_mesh` and `repair_mesh` to fix it first. An SVG
without absolute units and no recognized Inkscape version marker imports at an
assumed 96 dpi rather than asking, with a warning in the reply saying so. Use
`open_document` for `.FCStd` files.

### `export_document`

Export objects of a document to a file for 3D printing or CAD exchange,
without any dialog.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `path` (string, required): absolute path to write; its extension picks the
  format.
- `object_names` (array of strings, optional): objects to export; default the
  visible top-level objects with geometry.
- `per_object` (boolean, default `false`): write one file per object in
  `object_names` into the folder `path`, named after each object's label.
- `format` (string): with `per_object`, the extension of every file, one of the
  export formats below, such as `stl` or `step`; refused without `per_object`.
- `overwrite` (boolean, default `false`)
- `include_hidden` (boolean, default `false`): include hidden top-level
  objects in the default set.
- `recompute` (boolean, default `true`)
- `quality` (string, default `"standard"`, one of `coarse`, `standard`,
  `fine`): mesh formats and glTF tessellation preset.
- `linear_deflection` (number, optional, 0.001 to 100 mm): overrides the
  preset; mesh formats and glTF.
- `angular_deflection_deg` (number, optional, 0.5 to 90 degrees): overrides
  the preset; mesh formats only.
- `relative` (boolean, default `false`): mesh formats, `linear_deflection`
  relative to each edge's length.
- `ascii` (boolean, default `false`): STL only, write ASCII instead of
  binary.
- `step_unit` (string, optional, one of `MM`, `M`, `INCH`): STEP and IGES
  only; default FreeCAD's export preference.
- `step_schema` (string, optional, one of `AP203`, `AP214IS`, `AP242DIS`):
  STEP only; default FreeCAD's export preference.
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 300, up to 1800 seconds): raise it for
  fine meshes of large models.

The format follows the extension of `path`: `.stl` (binary, or ASCII with
`ascii` true), `.ast`, `.3mf`, `.amf`, `.obj`, `.ply` and `.off` are triangle
meshes for slicers, tessellated with `quality` or explicit
`linear_deflection`/`angular_deflection_deg`; 3MF and AMF keep one object per
part and declare millimeters. A 3MF carries each part's label as the object
name, so a slicer lists the parts by name (FreeCAD's own writer leaves the name
out; the addon adds it to the file after the export, with nothing else
changed). `.step`/`.stp` and `.iges`/`.igs` keep exact
geometry, names and colors. `.glb`/`.gltf` write a tessellated scene in
meters; `.gltf` also writes a separate `.bin` buffer next to it, named in the
reply's `companion_file`. `.brep`/`.brp` write the exact shape. `.FCStd`
writes a copy of the document. `.dxf` and `.svg` write 2D geometry projected
on the XY plane.

With `per_object`, one export runs per object and the reply lists every
file with its size and says when it created the folder; a name clash between
labels gets a number suffix, characters a file name cannot hold become an
underscore, and a Windows device name such as `CON` gets a leading underscore.

Without `object_names`, the visible top-level objects with geometry are
exported, so a Body is written once, not once per feature. The reply gives the
file, its size, the exported and skipped objects and, for meshes, the facet
count and whether the mesh is closed. An existing file is only replaced with
`overwrite` true. A missing folder in `path` is created and the reply says so;
a folder that cannot be created is an invalid-input error. Use
`save_document_as` to save the document itself, and `check_printability`
before exporting for a printer.

## Printability

### `check_printability`

Check a print layout before `export_document` writes it: every listed part
lies inside the plate and no two parts overlap. Lay each part flat on the
plate with its `Placement` first (the plate is x 0 to `bed_x`, y 0 to `bed_y`,
z up from 0, unless you move its corner with `bed_origin_x` and `bed_origin_y`), then call this. It does no meshing, so it is fast.
Solids and meshes both work: a `Mesh::Feature`, a link to one, or a container
holding one is placed by its global bounding box, with its `Placement` counted
once.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `object_names` (array of strings, optional): default the visible top-level
  solids and meshes.
- `bed_x`, `bed_y` (numbers, required, up to 10000 mm): plate width and depth.
- `bed_z` (number, optional, up to 10000 mm): build height; default not
  checked.
- `bed_origin_x`, `bed_origin_y` (numbers, optional, default 0, in mm): the
  plate's corner, so a second plate laid beside the first can be checked with
  its real size; the plate then spans x from `bed_origin_x` to `bed_origin_x +
  bed_x` and y likewise. The build height still starts at z 0.
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 120, up to 1800 seconds).

For each part, the reply gives its object name (and its label when that
differs), its size (tight bounding box), its free margin to the plate edges
(the distance from the nearest side of its box to a plate edge in x and y, and
to the build height when `bed_z` is given; the side that sits on the plate is
not counted; a sign shows only when the part is outside), and which parts it
overlaps. Space the parts apart before calling it: overlapping complex parts,
such as threads, make the intersection slow. Overlap of two solids is the volume
of their solid intersection, so a part sitting in another part's cavity
does not overlap it. A mesh is never converted: a pair with a mesh overlaps
when their bounding boxes share volume, so a part nested in a mesh's box counts
as overlapping, and the reply says so for that part (`overlap_checked_by` is
`bounding box`). The size is the tight box: for a swept solid such as a thread
it is exact, where `Shape.BoundBox` can be much wider. `printable` is true only when at least one part was
checked, every part is inside the plate and none overlaps; it is false, not
vacuously true, when nothing was checked. Move parts with `update_object` on
`Placement` until it is true. Invalid shapes usually come from a failed
feature; `recompute_document` shows which one, and `analyze_mesh` checks mesh
defects.

## FEM analysis

### `run_fem_analysis`

Run the CalculiX solver on an existing FEM analysis container and return
summary results.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `analysis_name` (string, required): the `Fem::AnalysisPython` object.
- `timeout` (integer, optional, default 600, 1 to 604800 seconds, a week).
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).

Prerequisites in the document, all created with `create_object`:

- A Part-derived solid (for example `Part::Box`, `PartDesign::Body`) as the
  geometry.
- A `Fem::AnalysisPython` container.
- A `Fem::MaterialCommon` assigned to the geometry, added to the analysis.
- A `Fem::FemMeshGmsh` referencing the geometry, added to the analysis (the
  mesh is generated automatically when created).
- At least one `Fem::ConstraintFixed` and one `Fem::ConstraintForce` (or
  `ConstraintPressure`) bound to faces of the geometry, added to the analysis.

A CalculiX solver already in the analysis is reused; a `SolverCcxTools` is
created when it has none. The solver runs synchronously on FreeCAD's GUI
thread, so other tools that need it wait until the analysis finishes; do not
send parallel requests. `get_rpc_status` and `get_async_status` stay
answerable while it runs.

The reply gives the maximum and minimum von Mises stress (MPa), the maximum
displacement (mm), the node count, the result object's name, the working
directory CalculiX wrote to, and every force and pressure of the analysis with
its magnitude and direction. With a 3D view the screenshot is coloured by von
Mises stress the way FreeCAD shows a result (the result pipeline's von Mises
field, with its colour bar, which is labelled in Pa: 1e6 Pa = 1 MPa), the reply
gives the range of the scale in MPa, and
the meshed solid and the mesh are hidden so the result shows; show them again
with `update_object` and `{"ViewObject": {"Visibility": true}}` (a shown solid
covers the stress colours: hide it again, or use `get_view`; the tool
description says so up front). Without a 3D view the reply carries the numbers
only. On failure it returns the prerequisite check or
solver error with the working directory for triage; `list_objects` shows what
the analysis holds.

See [`examples/cantilever_fem.py`](../examples/cantilever_fem.py) for an
end-to-end example, including geometry, material, mesh, constraints, and an
analytical comparison. For long analyses, configure the client to allow the
[queue and execution timeout budgets](execution.md#gui-dispatch-timeouts).

## Recompute, undo and redo

### `recompute_document`

Recompute every object of a document and report each that failed or is still
touched.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).
- `timeout` (number, optional, default 120, up to 1800 seconds).

Use it after a series of changes, after `delete_object` (dependents may
break), or when `open_document` reports the document needs a recompute. The
reply lists each failed object with FreeCAD's status message, and each object
still touched afterwards. Fix a failed object with `update_object` or remove
it with `delete_object`; failures do not make the call itself fail.

### `undo`

Undo the last changes to a document, one transaction per step.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `steps` (integer, default 1, 1 to 100): how many transactions to walk.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).

Every tool that changes a document records its changes as one transaction
named after the tool, such as `MCP: create_object`, next to edits made by hand
in FreeCAD. The reply names the transactions undone and those left to undo or
redo. Refused while a task panel is open in FreeCAD.

### `redo`

Redo changes that `undo` reverted, one transaction per step, in the order
they were undone.

- `doc_name` (string, required)
- `steps` (integer, default 1, 1 to 100)
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).

A new change made after an undo clears what can be redone. Refused while a
task panel is open in FreeCAD.

## Code execution

See [code execution](execution.md) for execution modes, shared script state,
background job tracking, and GUI dispatch timeout handling in detail.

### `execute_code`

Execute Python code in FreeCAD on its GUI thread and wait for the result. For
what the other tools do not cover: `FreeCAD`, `FreeCADGui` and the document
are available, and whatever the code prints is returned. Use it for quick
changes only, since it freezes FreeCAD while it runs: work that may take more
than a few seconds (booleans or distances between complex parts, threads,
fillets, meshing) goes to `execute_code_headless`.

- `code` (string): the Python code to execute. Pass exactly one of `code` and
  `path`.
- `path` (string): the absolute path of a `.py` file on the computer running
  FreeCAD, run instead of `code`. A script longer than about 30 lines belongs
  in a file: write it with your own file tools, run it with `path`, and fix it
  by editing the file and running it again. The file is compiled under its
  own path, so a traceback cites the file and its line, an error reply names
  both, and `__file__` is its path for the run. It shares the namespace, the
  transaction and the budgets of `code`. With remote access on that computer
  may not be yours: use `code` there.
- `timeout` (number, optional, up to 1800 seconds): seconds for each of the
  queue and GUI execution budgets, overriding the 90 second default; raise it
  for other slow work that must run on the GUI thread.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).

Use `import_file` and `export_document` for file exchange instead of
scripting it here; prefer `execute_code_async` for heavy pure-geometry work
that touches neither the document nor the GUI, and `execute_code_headless`
for OCCT work that may crash FreeCAD. Without a large enough `timeout`, a
slow call reports a timeout while the task keeps running, and its result is
lost.

### `execute_code_async`

Execute Python code in FreeCAD without waiting for completion, for
long-running background computations that do not touch the GUI or mutate the
document tree directly.

- `code` (string): background-safe Python code; use `commit(fn)` for every
  document and view write. Pass exactly one of `code` and `path`.
- `path` (string): the absolute path of a `.py` file on the computer running
  FreeCAD, run instead of `code`, with the same rules as for `execute_code`.

The call returns at once with a `job_id`; poll `get_async_status` with it. The
code runs in a background thread and must not call `FreeCADGui` APIs,
manipulate the active view or selection, create or edit document objects,
change object properties, call `doc.recompute()`, or save documents directly,
since FreeCAD documents and the scenegraph are not thread-safe. Every document
or view write instead goes through the injected `commit(fn, timeout=120)`
helper, which queues `fn` on the GUI thread, waits for it, and raises
`RuntimeError` on failure or timeout. Use this only when the heavy part is
long-running OCCT geometry or other CPU-bound work that would exceed
`execute_code`'s budget.

### `get_async_status`

Report the state of background jobs started by `execute_code_async` and by
`execute_code_headless`.

- `job_id` (string, optional): the job to report on; omit to list all running
  jobs and up to 20 recently finished ones, plus the headless jobs.

For an `execute_code_async` job it reports whether the job is running, done or
failed, with the error and traceback of a failed job; history is held in
memory until FreeCAD exits. For a headless job (its id starts with
`headless-`) it reports `running`, `finished` or `cancelled`, the exit code,
the elapsed seconds and the last 200 lines of output; see
`execute_code_headless`. It does not use the GUI thread, so it answers even
while a job runs, and a headless job's status does not need FreeCAD to be
running. An unknown `job_id` is a not-found error. `cancel_job` stops a
headless job.

A call that keeps the agent waiting longer than the background limit becomes
a job whose id starts with `call-` (see [long calls](execution.md#long-calls-move-to-the-background)).
While it runs, this tool reports its tool and elapsed time; once it ends it
returns that call's own reply, screenshot included, with `job_id` and `state:
finished` added to its front matter. The reply is kept for later reads and
forgotten a day after the call ends or when the MCP server exits. An empty
`job_id` lists these jobs with the others.

### `cancel_job`

Stop a background `execute_code_headless` job: its process and everything it
started end (on Windows the process tree lives in a job object that ends with
it, even when the MCP server itself is killed; on Linux and macOS the process
group is ended, and a hard kill of the MCP server can leave a running job
behind).

- `job_id` (string, required): the id of a headless job, from
  `execute_code_headless` or `get_async_status`.

The reply is the job's status with its last output. A job that had already
finished is reported as finished, with its exit code. An id that is not a
headless job is an invalid-input error; for a `call-` job the message says
FreeCAD cannot stop work already running in its window.

### `execute_code_headless`

Run a Python script in a separate `freecadcmd` process, isolated from the
running GUI.

- `code` (string): a complete Python script for `freecadcmd`. Pass exactly one
  of `code` and `path`.
- `path` (string): the absolute path of a `.py` file on the computer running
  this MCP server, run where it is instead of `code`. The file is never copied
  or deleted, and `__file__` is its path. A missing file is a not-found error
  and a relative path or a folder an invalid-input error, each naming the
  path.
- `timeout` (number, optional, up to 604800 seconds, a week): seconds to wait
  before killing the process; partial output is kept on timeout. Omitted, it
  is 600 seconds and the call waits for the script (foreground). A timeout you
  pass over 120 runs the script in the background unless `background` is
  `false`; an explicit 600 therefore runs in the background.
- `background` (boolean): `true` returns a `job_id` at once and runs the script
  in the background; `false` waits whatever the timeout. Omitted, only a
  timeout over 120 makes it a background run.

Use this for OCCT work that can crash or block FreeCAD: helical threads
(`makeHelix` + `makePipeShell`), lofts and sweeps, booleans with many or
B-spline tools, long parametric rebuilds. A native crash only kills the
helper process; the GUI and its open documents survive, and the reply reports
the crash (by signal or, on Windows, exception name) together with the
script's output.

The script runs on the machine hosting this MCP server, independently of
`FREECAD_MCP_HOST`, in a fresh process without GUI: import `FreeCAD` and
`Part` yourself, open documents from disk (`FreeCAD.openDocument(path)`), and
save results with `doc.save()`/`saveAs()` or `Shape.exportBrep()`. Nothing
from the `execute_code` namespace is available. Print progress to stdout; it
is returned when the process ends. Output is UTF-8, so text and paths with any
character print and read back (on Windows `freecadcmd`'s own pipes use the
ANSI code page, which made `print` of an arrow or an accented letter fail). After the script saves a `.FCStd` that is
open in the GUI, call `reload_document` to show the result.

A background run returns a `job_id` (`headless-` and eight hex digits) and the
path of the file its output streams to. `get_async_status` with the id reports
`running`, `finished` or `cancelled`, the exit code, the elapsed seconds and the
last 200 lines of output; `cancel_job` stops the job's process. The
first status of a finished job hands out the final output and removes the file;
later statuses repeat that output, and a finished job that nobody reads is
removed with its file after a day. Jobs end with the MCP server. While a
headless job runs (in the foreground or the background) and remote access is
on, the server keeps its session's lock alive, so the session does not look idle
to other agents; when the job ends, normal idle timing resumes. A foreground
run stays as it was: the call waits for the script and returns its output.

## View and screenshots

### `set_view`

Set what the user sees in a document's 3D view and leave it there. It changes
the view, not the model: nothing is added to the undo history and the document
gets no unsaved-changes mark.

- `doc_name` (string, optional): default the active document; its tab is
  brought to the front.
- `view_name` (string, optional): orientation, as for `get_view`; default keep
  the current one.
- `focus` (array of strings, optional): objects to frame; default everything
  visible.
- `show`, `hide`, `isolate` (arrays of strings, optional): visibility;
  `isolate` shows the listed objects and hides every other visible one, except
  the groups (a Body, a Part) that hold them, which stay visible so the objects
  are drawn; what else those groups hold is hidden, and `shown` lists the
  groups too. An isolated group (a Body, an App::Part) keeps what it holds.
- `transparency` (object of object name to 0 to 100), `display_mode` (object
  of object name to a mode such as `Flat Lines`).
- `mode` (string, default `"static"`, one of `static`, `orbit`, `tour`).
- `degrees_per_second` (number, default 15): orbit speed, negative turns the
  other way.
- `stops` (array, optional): tour stops with `focus`, `dwell_seconds` (default
  2) and `view_name`; default each visible object.
- `move_seconds` (number, default 2): travel time between tour stops.
- `loop` (boolean, default `false`): repeat the tour.
- `reset` (boolean, default `false`): restore what earlier calls changed and
  stop any running mode.
- `include_screenshot` (boolean, default `true`): attach a screenshot of the
  view as set.

An orbit or tour runs on FreeCAD's GUI thread until the user moves the view,
the next `set_view`, `reset` or the document closing. `get_view` pauses it for
the capture and resumes it. The reply states the camera and any running mode.
An orbit frames the sphere around the objects it shows (half their bounding box
diagonal as radius), so the whole model stays in view from every angle; a static
view and a tour frame the box itself.

### `get_view`

Get a screenshot of a document's 3D view from the given orientation.

- `doc_name` (string, optional): the document whose 3D view to capture;
  default the active document's active view.
- `view_name` (string, default `"Isometric"`): one of `Isometric`, `Front`,
  `Top`, `Right`, `Back`, `Left`, `Bottom`, `Dimetric`, `Trimetric`, or
  `Current`.
- `width`, `height` (integers, optional, 1 to 2048 pixels).
- `focus_object` (string, optional): an object to frame; default fit all
  objects in the view. Not allowed with `Current`.

`Current` captures exactly what the user sees: the camera as it is, not
re-framed, including a running `set_view` orbit or tour, which keeps running.
Nothing is paused, moved or restored for it, and `focus_object` with it is
refused (`invalid_input`).

With `doc_name`, that document's 3D view is captured, switching to it and
back if it is not already the active window; without it, the active
document's active view is used. Either way, FreeCAD's camera and selection
are left exactly as found afterwards (with `Current` they are never touched). When `width` and `height` are both
omitted, the image has the viewport's size, scaled down to keep its aspect
ratio when the longest edge exceeds 1024 pixels; with only one given, the
other is the viewport's size in that direction. A reply carries at most 1
MiB, so an image too large to fit is refused with a hint to ask for a smaller
one.

Fails when no document is open, `doc_name` is not an open document, that
document has no 3D view (opened hidden, or all its 3D views closed), or,
without `doc_name`, the active window is not a 3D view, such as a TechDraw
page or a spreadsheet.

## Screenshot options

The following tools can return an optional screenshot of the model after the
change: `create_object`, `update_object`, `delete_object`, `list_objects`,
`get_object`, `import_file`, `repair_mesh`, `mesh_to_solid`, `solid_to_mesh`,
`recompute_document`, `undo`, `redo`, `execute_code`,
`insert_part_from_library`, and `run_fem_analysis`.

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `include_screenshot` | `true` (`false` for `list_objects` and `get_object`, which only read) | Set to `false` for text-only feedback, such as analytical scripts or intermediate steps; set to `true` on `list_objects` or `get_object` to see the model. |
| `view_name` | `"Isometric"` | Orient the returned screenshot, for example `"Front"`, `"Top"`, or `"Right"`. |

The [`FREECAD_MCP_ONLY_TEXT_FEEDBACK` setting](configuration.md#text-feedback-and-screenshots)
suppresses these optional screenshots regardless of `include_screenshot`.

Use `get_view` to request a screenshot explicitly; it is available even with
`FREECAD_MCP_ONLY_TEXT_FEEDBACK` on, and takes `width`, `height` and
`focus_object` parameters the optional screenshots above do not. See
[view and screenshots](#view-and-screenshots) for its full details.

## Parts library

### `insert_part_from_library`

Insert a part from the [FreeCAD parts library](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-library)
addon into the active document.

- `relative_path` (string, required): the part's path inside the parts
  library, as `list_parts` shows it.
- `include_screenshot`, `view_name`: see [screenshot options](#screenshot-options).

Call `list_parts` first to find the part's relative path, then position it
with `update_object` and check it with `get_object`. A `relative_path` that
escapes the parts library, such as one using `..` to climb out of it, is
rejected as invalid; a path that stays inside the library but does not exist
there is a not-found error. Both hint to call `list_parts` to see the
available parts.

### `list_parts`

List the parts available in the FreeCAD parts library addon, as relative
paths for `insert_part_from_library`. Takes no arguments.

The list is empty when the parts library addon is not installed in FreeCAD;
build the shape with `create_object` instead in that case.

## Launch and status

### `start_freecad`

Start FreeCAD's GUI, with the MCP addon's RPC server, on the machine that
runs FreeCAD, when it is not running yet: the local machine, or, with
[remote access](remote-access.md) on, the computer sharing FreeCAD, through
its listener.

- `file` (string, optional): absolute path of an `.FCStd` file to open once
  FreeCAD has started, on the machine that runs FreeCAD.

The tool first checks whether FreeCAD already answers; if so it reports state
`already_running` and launches nothing, unless another agent holds it, in
which case it returns the "in use" error instead (see
[multi-agent rules](remote-access.md#multi-agent-rules)). Otherwise it starts
FreeCAD detached, with a startup macro that starts the RPC server on the
configured port, so the addon's auto-start setting does not matter. When
another FreeCAD window is already open without the RPC server, that FreeCAD
receives the request instead (state `forwarded`); when nothing answers on the
port within 10 seconds, the call fails saying the server did not answer, with
what to do: if that FreeCAD is busy, wait and call `get_rpc_status` before
closing it; otherwise start the RPC server from the FreeCAD MCP toolbar there,
turn on Auto-Start Server, or save, close that FreeCAD and call `start_freecad`
again. For a FreeCAD that already runs, use `open_document` instead of `file`.

On Windows, a server that runs outside the user's desktop (started over SSH or
as a service, in Windows session 0) never starts FreeCAD itself, since it
would be invisible. It asks the freecad-mcp listener on the same computer,
which runs on the user's desktop (`freecad-mcp share --on`), to start it; the
address and password come from the addon's settings file. With no listener
answering, the call fails with a message saying so; `execute_code_headless`
works without a desktop.

FreeCAD takes about 15 seconds to start, longer on its first start. The reply
returns at once: call `get_rpc_status` every few seconds until it reports
`rpc: reachable`, then continue with `list_documents`. A second call while a
launch is already starting reuses it instead of starting FreeCAD again, and
says so. Set `FREECAD_MCP_FREECAD` in the client's config when FreeCAD is
installed somewhere the server does not find. With remote access on, the
client's config has no effect there instead: set `FREECAD_MCP_FREECAD` on
the FreeCAD computer itself before turning on Share this PC, or turn Share
this PC on again after setting it, so freecad-mcp detects it there.

### `get_rpc_status`

Check FreeCAD's health without using its GUI thread, so it answers even while
FreeCAD has not started yet, is still starting, has exited, or a GUI
operation elsewhere is stuck. Takes no arguments.

Reports `freecad` (`running`, `starting`, `not_running`, `exited` or
`unresponsive`) and `rpc` (`reachable` or `unreachable`). While reachable, the
reply carries the full status, including `gui_dispatch` (names a GUI
operation still stuck) and `version_check` (`ok`, or whether the addon or this
server needs updating), and the open documents. While not reachable, it
carries the process id, elapsed time since `start_freecad`, exit code and
launch log tail known so far, plus the documents last seen before FreeCAD
stopped answering. While `freecad` is `unresponsive` and FreeCAD runs on this
computer (the configured host is loopback and the process id came from this
computer's own status reading), the tool samples the FreeCAD process's CPU
over 2 seconds and adds `cpu_cores`; `busy: true` (about 0.5 cores or more)
means FreeCAD is computing, not stuck behind a dialog, and the advice is to
wait and poll again. The last known documents say how long ago they were read;
the reading is refreshed after every create, open, close, import and save as.

With [remote access](remote-access.md) on, the reply also carries
`session_lock` (`off`, `free`, `yours` or `other`; `unknown` while FreeCAD is
down and remote access is known to be on regardless, since its actual state
cannot be read without FreeCAD; left out entirely when that is not knowable
either, because FreeCAD has not answered at all yet) and, while it is held,
`session_holder`, `session_idle_seconds` and `session_frees_in_seconds`: who
holds FreeCAD (a label such as `claude-code on WILD-DESKTOP #a3f2`: the short
tag ends every session's label, so two sessions of one app on one computer
read differently, and a refusal says "another session" with both labels), or
that this agent does, how long they have been idle, and
when the claim frees on its own. See
[multi-agent rules](remote-access.md#multi-agent-rules) for what claims it
and how `release_session` and `close_freecad` manage it.
On Windows, a reachable FreeCAD that runs in a hidden session (session 0,
started from an SSH login or a service) adds `desktop: hidden` and says the
user cannot see it: save, `close_freecad`, then `start_freecad`. The reply is
unchanged otherwise.
While reachable, the reply also names the computer FreeCAD actually runs on
("FreeCAD is running on \<hostname\> and its RPC server answered"). When this
MCP server is configured to reach FreeCAD through `localhost` but another
computer answers there instead, every call, not only this one, is refused
until the setup is fixed: see
[WSL and Windows on the same computer](remote-access.md#wsl-and-windows-on-the-same-computer)
for why that happens and how to fix it.

This is the tool to poll after `start_freecad` until it reports `rpc:
reachable`, and to call whenever another tool times out, fails because
FreeCAD is in use by another agent, or FreeCAD's state is unclear. Once it
reports running, use `list_documents` for the full per-document detail.

### `release_session`

Free the FreeCAD session this agent holds, so another agent can use FreeCAD
at once instead of waiting for the idle timeout. Listed only while
[remote access](remote-access.md) is on. Takes no arguments.

With remote access on, an agent's first call to FreeCAD, other than
`start_freecad` and `get_rpc_status`, claims FreeCAD for that agent until it
has been idle for the configured timeout; `get_rpc_status` shows who holds it
and when it frees. This only frees this agent's own session: documents stay
open and unsaved changes stay unsaved, so call `save_document` first. When a
job this agent started (`execute_code_async`, or a GUI operation that outlived
its own timeout) is still running, the session stays held until that job
ends, then frees on its own.

### `close_freecad`

Quit FreeCAD on the computer that runs it and free the session, for example
at the end of a work session. Listed only while
[remote access](remote-access.md) is on.

- `discard_changes` (boolean, optional, default false): quit even when
  documents have unsaved changes, losing them.

Refused while there are unsaved changes and `discard_changes` is not true
(save them first with `save_document` or `save_document_as`), or while a
task panel or command is open in FreeCAD. FreeCAD closes a moment after the
reply; `start_freecad` opens it again.
