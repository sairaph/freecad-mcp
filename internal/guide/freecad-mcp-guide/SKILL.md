description: Workflows and rules for the freecad MCP server's tools. Use when building or changing FreeCAD models through create_object and update_object, choosing faces or edges with list_subelements, setting values with units or expressions, setting up and running a FEM analysis, checking and exporting parts for 3D printing, designing printed fits, threads and clips for a print material such as PETG or PLA, working with files on the FreeCAD computer, or sharing one FreeCAD with other agents.

# FreeCAD MCP guide

Call the tools of the freecad server by their bare names, such as create_object. Your client may add a prefix.

## Start

1. Call start_freecad when FreeCAD is not running. It reports already_running when FreeCAD answers.
2. Poll get_rpc_status every 3 to 5 seconds until it reports rpc: reachable. Give up after 120 seconds.
3. Call list_documents. Call create_document or open_document when it is empty.
4. Call list_objects with compact true to learn the object names.

## Rules

- Lengths in mm and angles in degrees may be numbers. Give every other quantity as a string with its unit: "100 N", "2 MPa", "210 GPa". A bare Force of 100 is 0.1 N. Read values.md.
- A value starting with "=" binds an expression: "=Params.thickness". "=" alone removes it.
- Link properties take object names: "Box", or ["Box", "Cylinder"] for a list.
- Never guess Face or Edge names. Call list_subelements first. Read subelements.md.
- Use the object name each reply returns. FreeCAD may rename Box to Box001.
- Paths are on the computer running FreeCAD. Nothing is transferred. Read files.md.
- Use execute_code only for what no tool covers. Read code.md.
- An error before the object exists creates nothing: fix the argument and call create_object again. An object that was created but does not compute stays and the reply names it: fix it with update_object or delete_object. Never repeat the call with the same name.
- Every changing call is one undo step. Call undo to revert.
- Close a scratch document of your own when you are done: close_document with discard_changes true. It is the normal cleanup.
- Changing tools attach a screenshot by default. Pass include_screenshot false on intermediate steps and call get_view at the end. get_object and list_objects attach none unless include_screenshot is true.

## Checklists

Build a part:
1. For a part that will be 3D printed and has holes, fits, threads or clips, read the material file for its material first, such as material-petg.md, and features.md for screw head recesses, cable channels and edges to round. Ask for the material when it is not known.
2. create_object for each solid, with Placement and dimensions in obj_properties.
3. create_object for booleans such as Part::Cut with Base and Tool as object names.
4. recompute_document after a series of changes. Fix each failed object with update_object.
5. get_object to check values. get_view to look at the result.
6. save_document_as for a new file, save_document for an existing one.

Change a part:
1. list_objects with compact true, then get_object for the object.
2. update_object with only the properties that change.
3. recompute_document, then check the reply for invalid objects.

Print a part:
1. Check that fits, threads and clips follow the material file for the part's material.
2. Lay each part flat on the plate with update_object on Placement, then check_printability with bed_x and bed_y.
3. Fix what it reports. Read printing.md.
4. export_document to .stl or .3mf with overwrite true when replacing.

Show the user a part:
1. set_view with view_name and focus to leave the 3D view as they should see it. focus frames those objects and leaves the others visible; isolate shows only them. Use mode orbit to turn around it, or mode tour with stops to visit objects one by one.
2. Call set_view with mode static to stop a running orbit or tour. get_view looks without changing the view.

Simulate a part (FEM):
1. Read fem.md. Create the analysis, material and mesh with create_object and analysis_name.
2. list_subelements on the solid for the fixed and loaded faces.
3. Create the constraints with analysis_name and those faces.
4. run_fem_analysis. Send no other call while it runs.

Drive a part from parameters:
1. Read parametric.md. Put the numbers in a Spreadsheet::Sheet and bind properties with "=".

Share FreeCAD with other agents:
1. Read session.md. Save, then call release_session or close_freecad when you stop.

## Guide files

Each file named here sits in the same folder as this SKILL.md (the folder freecad-mcp-guide). Loading the skill loads only this page: read a file with your file tools when a line says to. Where the text of a file follows this page, use that.

- values.md: quantities, units, expressions, links, Placement, colors. Read before any create_object or update_object that sets more than a plain length.
- subelements.md: choosing faces and edges. Read before measure or a FEM constraint.
- fem.md: FEM from analysis to result. Read before the first FEM object.
- files.md: paths, formats, import, export, save. Read before touching a file.
- session.md: remote access, holding and releasing FreeCAD. Read when a call is refused as in use, or when get_rpc_status shows a holder.
- printing.md: laying parts on the plate, the layout check, export. Read before exporting for a printer.
- material-petg.md, material-pla.md: clearances, threads, clips, strength and limits for one print material. Read the user's material before modelling parts that fit together.
- features.md: screw head recesses, cable channels, which edges to round. Read before modelling them.
- mesh.md: measuring a tessellated design, patching selected facets, comparing two meshes. Read before working on a mesh in a script.
- parametric.md: spreadsheets as parameters. Read before binding a property to a cell.
- code.md: execute_code, execute_code_async, execute_code_headless. Read before writing a script.
