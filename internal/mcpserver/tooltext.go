// Every tool's title, description, annotations and parameter descriptions
// live in this file, so the wording is reviewed in one place and the size
// limits in tooltext_test.go apply to all of it. addTool applies a tool's text
// to its schema at registration and panics on a mismatch, so a parameter never
// ships without a description.
//
// The rules the texts follow: a description is at most maxDescriptionBytes
// (some clients cut long ones), the first sentence says what the tool does,
// and every rule that changes how an argument is written sits in that
// argument's description, because the schema reaches every client whole.

const serverInstructions = `FreeCAD CAD modelling: create, change, measure and simulate (FEM) parts, and import, export and save FreeCAD documents on the computer running FreeCAD. Search for these tools whenever the user asks for CAD, 3D models, parts, FEM, STEP, STL or 3MF files, or 3D printing.
Start: call start_freecad when FreeCAD is not running (it reports already_running otherwise), poll get_rpc_status every 3-5 s until rpc: reachable, then call list_documents and list_objects with compact true.
Rules for every call:
- Property values: lengths in mm and angles in degrees may be numbers; give every other quantity as a string with its unit ("100 N", "2 MPa", "210 GPa"). A bare Force of 100 is 0.1 N.
- A value starting with "=" binds an expression ("=Params.thickness"); "=" alone removes it. Link properties take object names.
- Call list_subelements to find Face and Edge names before measure or FEM References. Never guess them.
- Use the object name each reply returns; FreeCAD may rename (Box001).
- Paths are on the computer running FreeCAD; nothing is transferred.
- Use execute_code only for what no tool covers.
- A call that runs past the user's background limit returns a job_id starting with call-: poll get_async_status with it.
- With remote access, your first call claims FreeCAD for you: save, then call release_session or close_freecad when you stop.`

	"check_printability": {
		Description: `Check a print layout: every listed part lies inside the plate (x and y from its corner, which is 0, 0 unless you pass bed_origin_x and bed_origin_y; z up from 0) and no two parts overlap. Solids and meshes both work. Lay each part flat on the plate with its Placement and space the parts apart first, then call this; overlapping complex parts such as threads make the intersection slow. Per part: tight size, free margin to the plate edges, and what it overlaps. Two solids overlap by the volume of their solid intersection, so a part in another's cavity is fine; a mesh is checked by its bounding box, so a part nested in a mesh's box counts as overlapping. Nothing is meshed, so it is fast. Move parts with update_object until printable is true. printable is true only when something was checked, every part is inside and none overlaps. Find failed features with recompute_document; analyze_mesh checks mesh defects.`,

		Description: `Analyze a mesh object (Mesh::Feature, such as an imported STL) for defects that break printing and mesh_to_solid: open edges, non-manifold edges, self-intersections, flipped facets, invalid points, corrupted facets, separate components.

		Description: `Convert a mesh object into a new Part solid for booleans, fillets and STEP export; the mesh stays. Each triangle becomes a face: above 200000 facets pass force true, and refine merges coplanar faces. An open mesh gives a shell, not a solid: run analyze_mesh and repair_mesh first.`,

		Description: `Run CalculiX on a FEM analysis and return max and min von Mises stress (MPa), max displacement (mm), node count, the result object and the working directory. The analysis needs, all made with create_object and analysis_name: a Fem::MaterialCommon, a Fem::FemMeshGmsh of the solid, a Fem::ConstraintFixed and a Fem::ConstraintForce or Fem::ConstraintPressure on faces from list_subelements. A CalculiX solver is added when missing. It colours the 3D view by von Mises stress and hides the FEM mesh and the meshed solid; the reply names them and how to show them again. It blocks FreeCAD's GUI thread until done: do not send other calls meanwhile; get_rpc_status still answers.`,

	// Code.
	"execute_code": {
		Description: `Run Python in FreeCAD's GUI thread and return what it prints; FreeCAD, FreeCADGui and the documents are available. Use it only for what no other tool covers, and only for quick changes: it freezes FreeCAD while it runs. Work that may take more than a few seconds (booleans or distances between complex parts, threads, fillets, meshing) goes to execute_code_headless. It has a time budget to start and another to run (90 s each by default); pass timeout for slower work. Use execute_code_async for long pure-geometry work on shapes already fetched. A script longer than about 30 lines goes in a .py file, run with path. File paths, path included, are on the computer running FreeCAD. Set include_screenshot false for code that does not change the model.`,

		},
	},
	"execute_code_async": {
		Description: `Run long, CPU-heavy Python (OCCT fuse, cut, loft on shapes already fetched) in a background thread; the call returns a job_id at once: poll get_async_status. The code must not touch the GUI or the document: no FreeCADGui, view or selection calls, no object creation or property changes, no recompute, no save. Doing so can hang FreeCAD. Hand every document or view write to the GUI thread with the injected commit(fn, timeout=120), which runs fn there and returns its result. Pattern: fetch shapes into module variables with execute_code, compute here, then commit(apply). Example:
    fused = base.fuse(addition).removeSplitter()
    def apply():
        obj.Shape = fused
        doc.recompute()
    commit(apply)
Scripts share one namespace across calls. get_async_status gives state, error and traceback, not printed output: read results with execute_code. Fuse many additions first, then apply one boolean to the heavy shape. File paths, path included, are on the computer running FreeCAD.`,
		Params: map[string]string{
			"code": "background-safe Python; send every document or view write through commit(fn). Pass exactly one of code and path",
			"path": pathText,
		},
	},
	"execute_code_headless": {
		Description: `Run a Python script in a separate freecadcmd process without GUI, so an OpenCascade crash kills only that process; use it for helical threads, lofts, sweeps, many-tool booleans and long rebuilds. It runs on the computer running this MCP server, not on the computer running FreeCAD, and shares nothing with execute_code: import FreeCAD and Part, open files with FreeCAD.openDocument(path), save with doc.save() or Shape.exportBrep(), print progress. __file__ is the script's path. Its path parameter is a file on that same computer. A failed script still returns everything it printed, then the traceback. A script that may take minutes runs in the background: the call returns a job_id at once and get_async_status reports it. After it saves an .FCStd open in the GUI, call reload_document.`,
		Params: map[string]string{
			"code":       "complete Python script for freecadcmd. Pass exactly one of code and path",
			"path":       "absolute path of a .py file on the computer running this MCP server, run where it is instead of code. Pass exactly one of code and path",
			"timeout":    "seconds before the process is killed; partial output is kept; omitted: 600 s in the foreground; a timeout over 120 runs in the background unless background is false",
			"background": "true: return a job_id at once and run the script in the background, its output streaming to a file; poll get_async_status; false: wait for the script whatever the timeout (default: background only for a timeout over 120)",
		},
	},
	"get_async_status": {
		Description: `Report background jobs: execute_code_async jobs (running, done or failed, with error and traceback) and execute_code_headless jobs (running, finished or cancelled, exit code, elapsed seconds, the last 200 lines of output). Answers while a job runs. Async jobs are kept until FreeCAD exits; headless jobs until the MCP server exits or a day after they finish. Stop a headless job with cancel_job. A call- job is a call that ran past the background limit: it returns that call's own reply when it ends.`,
		Params: map[string]string{

		},

	"cancel_job": {
		Description: `Stop a background execute_code_headless job: its process and everything it started end. The reply is the job's status with its last output. A job that had already finished is reported as finished, with its exit code. A call- job cannot be stopped: FreeCAD ends it when the work finishes.`,
