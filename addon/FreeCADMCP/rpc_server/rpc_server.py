        While remote access is on, this only ever sees jobs the calling
        session itself started: get_async_status is exempt from the session
        lock (it must work for the holder even while another agent's call is
        refused), but that would otherwise let any agent read another's job,
        including the first part of its code and, on failure, its error and
        traceback, which can hold paths and data (live-fixes review L3). A
        job or job_id belonging to someone else reads exactly like one that
        never existed, not a permission error, so this call never confirms
        or denies another session's activity.

        pass it to get_async_status to read the job's state (``running``,
        ``done`` or ``failed``) and, when it failed, its error and traceback.
        Starting a job never waits for the GUI thread.

        Thread-safety contract (read before using this method):

        FreeCAD documents and the Coin3D scenegraph are NOT thread-safe. Code run
        here executes off the GUI thread, so it must not touch them directly.
        Assigning ``obj.Shape``, calling ``doc.recompute()``, ``doc.addObject()``,
        ``doc.save()`` or any ``ViewObject`` from this thread races the GUI thread
        and can wedge FreeCAD's event loop, after which the RPC server stops
        answering entirely.

        Safe pattern: build shapes in the background, then hand the document write
        to the GUI thread via the injected ``commit`` helper::

            box = Part.makeBox(10, 10, 10)          # background: fine
            fused = base.fuse(box).removeSplitter()  # background: fine, this is the slow part

                obj.Shape = fused
                doc.recompute()

            commit(apply)                            # blocks until the GUI thread ran it

        ``commit(fn, timeout=...)`` returns ``fn``'s value, or raises RuntimeError
        if the GUI dispatch failed or timed out. The helper persists so saved
        functions can reuse it in later async calls. It may only be called from
        an async worker, not from a synchronous script or GUI callback.
