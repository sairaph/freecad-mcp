"""Addon version reported to the MCP server through get_rpc_status."""

# The freecad-mcp binary embeds this addon, so the two always ship together.
# Keep in step with <version> in ../package.xml.
__version__ = "0.4.19"

# Bump when the RPC contract changes in a way the MCP server must know about:
# a method or parameter is added or removed, or a response shape or meaning
# changes. Must match ProtocolVersion in internal/domain/domain.go.
# 2: a Placement's Rotation Angle is in degrees both ways,
#    get_active_screenshot raises a Fault on failure (None only for a view
#    that cannot be captured), and reload_document reports the name of the
#    document it reopened.
# 3: document, file, recompute, printability, mesh, undo, spreadsheet,
#    measure and selection methods are added; failures carry a code and a
#    hint; get_active_screenshot takes doc_name and replies with a dict that
#    holds the image or the reason nothing was captured; get_objects takes
#    compact; object replies add bound box, centre of mass, validity and
#    linked object names; get_rpc_status reports the open documents; mutating
#    replies name the transaction that holds their changes.
# 4: the RPC server always binds 127.0.0.1 (remote access goes through the
#    freecad-mcp listener); the X-FreeCAD-MCP-Session and
#    X-FreeCAD-MCP-Client headers identify the calling session; with remote
#    access on, a session lock refuses other sessions with Fault 4230 (4231
#    once after a forced release); release_session and close_freecad are
#    added; get_rpc_status reports session; replies carry X-FreeCAD-MCP-Lock.
# 5: list_subelements is added; create_object and update_object replies may
#    carry quantities (each quantity property set, with its value and unit)
#    and load (the direction of a force or pressure constraint); objects
#    report SolidCount; run_fem_analysis replies carry loads and, when a 3D
#    view exists, the von Mises colouring (coloured, colour_range_MPa,
#    hidden_objects); a quantity property is shown in FreeCAD's preferred
#    units everywhere.
# 6: set_view is added (static, orbit and tour camera control on the GUI
#    thread); check_printability takes only bed_x, bed_y and bed_z and
#    replies with the layout check (margins, overlaps) instead of mesh
#    results; object replies and sizes carry tight bound boxes.
# 7: keep_alive is added (the MCP server keeps the session lock alive while a
#    headless job of that session runs; it also tells the banner over the 3D
#    view about the job); check_printability options add an optional plate
#    corner, origin [x, y].
# 8: execute_file and execute_file_async are added (run a script file);
#    get_rpc_status reports background_after_minutes.
