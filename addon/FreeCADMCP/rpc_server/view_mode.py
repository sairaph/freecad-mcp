"""What the user sees: static poses, orbit and tour, for the set_view tool.

Everything here runs on FreeCAD's GUI thread. An animated mode is one
``QTimer`` per 3D view (the engine) that writes the camera node directly with
pivy; a camera field write redraws the view by itself (verified on FreeCAD
1.1.3), so no explicit redraw is needed. FreeCAD's own animation calls are not
used: ``startAnimating`` has no state and get_view kills it, ``viewPosition``
blocks, and ``fitAll`` runs a nested event loop that would run the ticks
re-entrantly.

Interrupt rule: each tick compares the live camera with the pose this engine
wrote last. Any difference (a mouse drag, the wheel, the NaviCube, another
tool) stops the mode. A mode also stops on ``stop_mode``, ``reset``, when its
document closes or its view is destroyed (the view is looked up again by
document name on every tick), and when the RPC server stops.

get_view pauses the engine around its capture (``pause`` and ``resume``): the
capture changes the camera and restores it, which would otherwise read as a
foreign change.
