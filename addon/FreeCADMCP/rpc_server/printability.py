"""Print-layout check: parts lie inside the plate and do not overlap.

The agent lays each part flat on the plate (positions in the document, x and y
from 0, z up from 0); this checks the layout without meshing anything: every
part's tight bounding box lies inside the plate box, and no two parts share
volume (the volume of their solid intersection, not only of their bounding
boxes, which a bracket around another part would overlap). Each part reports
its size and its free margin to the plate edges.

A mesh (a Mesh::Feature, or a link or container holding one) is never meshed
or converted: its global bounding box is its extent, and a pair with a mesh
overlaps when their boxes share volume, so a part nested in a mesh's box counts
as overlapping. Only two solids get the exact intersection.

Boolean common of two heavy shapes can take long, and it runs on FreeCAD's GUI
thread, so pairs are checked only while the call's timeout has time left; the
pairs left are listed as not checked, never guessed.

GUI thread only.
