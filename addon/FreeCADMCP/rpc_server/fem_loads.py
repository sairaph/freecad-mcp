"""Describe the direction a FEM force or pressure constraint acts in.

A ``Fem::ConstraintForce`` acts along ``DirectionVector``: the outward normal
of its first referenced face, or the direction of its ``Direction`` link when
one is set, flipped when ``Reversed`` is true (Mod/Fem/App/FemConstraintForce.cpp
``onChanged``). A ``Fem::ConstraintPressure`` presses into its faces, and
``Reversed`` pulls outward (femsolver/calculix/write_constraint_pressure.py
writes P with the sign flipped). Both read the face normal FreeCAD keeps in
``NormalDirection``.
